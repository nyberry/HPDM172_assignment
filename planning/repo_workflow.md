## Development

Branch strategy
- main: stable, deliverable code only
- dev: active development
- feature branches: small chunks of work

## Suggested workflow
1. Create branch from dev
2. Make changes
3. Push branch
4. Open a Pull Request into dev
5. Two group members review
6. Merge into dev
7. When a milestone is reached, merge dev into main
