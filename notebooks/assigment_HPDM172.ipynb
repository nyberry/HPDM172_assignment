    "\n",
    "This section sets up the MySQL database that will be used throughout the notebook.\n",
    "Unlike SQLite, which is file-based, MySQL is a client–server relational database, so the workflow involves connecting to a running MySQL server, creating the database if it does not already exist, and then selecting it for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following initialisation steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the required Python library (mysql.connector)\n",
    "This provides the Python interface for connecting to, creating, and querying a MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish a connection to the MySQL server\n",
    "Using a username, password, host, and (optionally) database name.\n",
    "If the database does not yet exist, the notebook will create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the project database (hospitaldb) if necessary\n",
    "This ensures the notebook is fully reproducible and can be run on any machine with MySQL installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the database and create a reusable cursor object\n",
    "The cursor will be used for executing SQL commands throughout the notebook, including table creation, data insertion, and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this initialisation step is complete, the conn (connection) and cur (cursor) objects will be available for all SQL operations in later sections of the notebook. This provides a consistent starting point for defining the schema, populating tables with synthetic data, and running analytical queries."
