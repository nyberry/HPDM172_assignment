## 1. Progress Update

The group discussed current progress on the creation of the hospital database. Members shared their initial findings and challenges encountered so far.

---

## 2. Timeline Review

The proposed project timeline was reviewed. The group agreed to aim for **completion by 6th December**, allowing additional buffer time to manage unforeseen difficulties.

---

## 3. Repository Structure

Several repository models were reviewed. The group agreed to adopt a **simple, clear structure** consisting of separate files for:

- SQL database schema (tables and relationships)
- SQL queries (use cases and analysis)
- Design document (architecture, assumptions, constraints)
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This structure was chosen to ensure clarity, maintainability, and ease of marking.

## 4. Task Allocation

The main areas of work were divided as follows:

1. **Database architecture** – schema design, tables, relationships; database creation  
2. **SQL queries** – SELECT queries, JOINs, aggregation, etc.  
3. **Testing and quality assurance** – validation of structure and data integrity  
4. **Repository organisation and documentation** – README, structure, explanations  
5. **Populating the SQL database** – inserting realistic example data  

Each member will begin work on these areas over the coming days. Exact sub-tasks will be refined as work progresses.
